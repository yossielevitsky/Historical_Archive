                            The Portuguese Synagogue of Antwerp, located on Hoveniersstraat, stands as the spiritual
                            heart of the Sephardic
                            community. It represents a rich tradition of Spanish and Portuguese Jewry that found refuge
                            and flourished in the city.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Architecture & Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Built in 1913, the synagogue features a distinct Neo-Romanesque style with Byzantine
                            influences, setting it apart
                            from other synagogues in Antwerp. The interior is known for its elegant simplicity,
                            featuring dark wooden pews
                            and a traditional layout centered around the Tebah (Bimah).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Historical Information</h2>
                        <p>
                            The synagogue was commissioned to serve the growing community of Sephardic Jews, many of
                            whom were involved in the diamond trade.
                            Miraculously, the building survived the Second World War with relatively minor damage
                            compared to others, allowing it
                            to continue serving the community almost continuously for over a century.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Community Life</h3>
                        <p>
                            The synagogue follows the Western Sephardic rite (Minhag Amsterdam/London). It remains an
                            active center for prayer
                            and community gatherings, maintaining unique liturgical traditions and melodies that date
                            back centuries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the morning of October 20, 1981, tragedy struck the heart of Antwerp's Diamond District.
                            Shortly after 9:00 AM, just minutes before Simchat Torah services were scheduled to begin, a
                            massive truck bomb exploded outside the Portuguese Synagogue.
                            The blast claimed the lives of three people and left 106 others wounded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The bomb had been concealed in a delivery truck that was parked overnight with a wheel
                            removed, staging a breakdown.
                            The force of the explosion was devastating, blowing in the synagogue's heavy doors and
                            intricate stained-glass windows,
                            and shattering storefronts for blocks around. Only the vehicle's axles and debris remained.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Investigations revealed the truck was purchased by a man using the alias "Nicola Brazzi,"
                            believed to be of Lebanese origin.
                            While the Palestinian terrorist group Black September claimed responsibility, the
                            investigation saw various turns,
                            including the arrest of neo-Nazi suspects and later, in 2008, the arrest of a suspect in
                            Canada linked to both this attack and the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prime Minister Mark Eyskens condemned the act as "diabolically wicked." It occurred just one
                            year after a similar attack in Paris
                            and followed a hand grenade attack on Jewish schoolchildren in Antwerp just months prior,
                            marking a dark period for the community
                            that ultimately strengthened their resolve and unity.
