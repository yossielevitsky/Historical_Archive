                            Jews may have followed the Roman legions to what is today Belgium around 53–57 CE,
                            but no continuous Jewish presence from this period has been firmly established.
                            The earliest documented organized Jewish settlement in the region dates to the early
                            11th century.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1022, Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, invited Jacob bar Jequthiel and thirty other Jews
                            from Rouen to settle in Arras. This invitation was motivated primarily by economic
                            considerations, as Jewish merchants and financiers were seen as contributors to regional
                            development. Although Arras is today located in northern France, it was at the time part
                            of the County of Flanders, a territory historically linked to what is now Belgium.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first tangible archaeological proof of a Jewish presence in present-day Belgium
                            dates to the 13th century. A tombstone from 1255–1256, discovered in Tienen
                            (Tirlemont), bears the name <em>Rebecca bat Moshe</em>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By the 13th century, Jewish communities were established in Brabant, including Antwerp
                            and Brussels, as well as in other urban centers of the region. The first official document
                            referring specifically to a Jewish community in Antwerp appears in the will of Henry III,
                            Duke of Brabant. In 1261, he expressed his wish that the Jews of Brabant be expelled,
                            citing their perceived role as usurers. Although this expulsion was never carried out,
                            Jewish residents were subjected to increased taxation and legal restrictions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Jews—mostly originating from German territories
                            along the Rhine—settled in the Duchy of Brabant, particularly in Brussels,
                            and in the County of Hainaut, especially in Mons. These communities were small and fragile.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the mid-14th century, amid the outbreak of the Bubonic Plague (1348–1349),
                            Jews in Antwerp and other major cities were accused of poisoning wells.
                            These accusations led to severe persecution, with many Jews being hanged,
                            burned at the stake, beaten to death, or drowned. Similar violence occurred across
                            the region, contributing to the destruction of several Jewish communities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1370, Jews in Brussels who had survived earlier persecutions were burned at the stake,
                            leading to the near-total disappearance of the Jewish community in the city.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Additional evidence of Jewish life in medieval Belgium includes a Hebrew manuscript
                            dated to 1310, preserved in the University of Hamburg library,
                            which was written by a scribe from Brussels.

                        <p>
                            After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497,
                            converted wealthy Jewish traders, whom the Inquisition described as Crypto-Jews,
                            dispersed all over Europe. Crypto-Jews were Jews who had been forced to convert to
                            Christianity but continued to practice Judaism in secret. They also settled in the
                            Seventeen Provinces of the Low Countries under Spanish rule. The old Southern
                            provinces correspond roughly to present-day Belgium, and the Northern provinces to
                            the present-day Netherlands. The Netherlands became an independent country after
                            the Treaty of Münster in 1648 and was renamed the Republic of the Seven United Provinces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While Spanish Jews settled in the Netherlands in the 16th century, they and others,
                            most likely Crypto-Jews, also settled in Antwerp and Bruges.
                            At the beginning of the 16th century, the Crypto-Jews living in Antwerp played an
                            important role in the economic and financial affairs of the town. Because of Spanish
                            pressure, most of them left Antwerp around 1540–1550, ending the second Jewish
                            immigration in the region.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although some Crypto-Jews returned to Antwerp during the 17th century, they could no
                            longer enjoy the same economic and financial status they had a century earlier.
                            A secret synagogue existed in Antwerp from 1650 to 1694, and some Crypto-Jewish poets
                            also lived in Brussels during that time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After Antwerp came under Austrian rule in 1713, Jews were able to practice their religion
                            more openly. They gained even greater freedom following the promulgation of the
                            “Edict of Tolerance” by Habsburg Emperor Joseph II in 1781.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the 18th century, Jewish presence in the Southern provinces, under Austrian
                            rule, remained low; about 100 Jews – householders – lived in Brussels in 1756.
