                            Jews may have followed the Roman legions to what is today Belgium around 53–57 CE,
                            but no continuous Jewish presence from this period has been firmly established.
                            The earliest documented organized Jewish settlement in the region dates to the early
                            11th century.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1022, Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, invited Jacob bar Jequthiel and thirty other Jews
                            from Rouen to settle in Arras. This invitation was motivated primarily by economic
                            considerations, as Jewish merchants and financiers were seen as contributors to regional
                            development. Although Arras is today located in northern France, it was at the time part
                            of the County of Flanders, a territory historically linked to what is now Belgium.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first tangible archaeological proof of a Jewish presence in present-day Belgium
                            dates to the 13th century. A tombstone from 1255–1256, discovered in Tienen
                            (Tirlemont), bears the name <em>Rebecca bat Moshe</em>.

                        <p>
                            By the 13th century, Jewish communities were established in Brabant, including Antwerp
                            and Brussels, as well as in other urban centers of the region. The first official document
                            referring specifically to a Jewish community in Antwerp appears in the will of Henry III,
                            Duke of Brabant. In 1261, he expressed his wish that the Jews of Brabant be expelled,
                            citing their perceived role as usurers. Although this expulsion was never carried out,
                            Jewish residents were subjected to increased taxation and legal restrictions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Jews—mostly originating from German territories
                            along the Rhine—settled in the Duchy of Brabant, particularly in Brussels,
                            and in the County of Hainaut, especially in Mons. These communities were small and fragile.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the mid-14th century, amid the outbreak of the Bubonic Plague (1348–1349),
                            Jews in Antwerp and other major cities were accused of poisoning wells.
                            These accusations led to severe persecution, with many Jews being hanged,
                            burned at the stake, beaten to death, or drowned. Similar violence occurred across
                            the region, contributing to the destruction of several Jewish communities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1370, Jews in Brussels who had survived earlier persecutions were burned at the stake,
                            leading to the near-total disappearance of the Jewish community in the city.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Additional evidence of Jewish life in medieval Belgium includes a Hebrew manuscript
                            dated to 1310, preserved in the University of Hamburg library,
                            which was written by a scribe from Brussels.

                            After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1497,
                            converted wealthy Jewish traders, whom the Inquisition described as Crypto-Jews,
                            dispersed all over Europe. Crypto-Jews were Jews who had been forced to convert to
                            Christianity but continued to practice Judaism in secret. They also settled in the
                            Seventeen Provinces of the Low Countries under Spanish rule. The old Southern
                            provinces correspond roughly to present-day Belgium, and the Northern provinces to
                            the present-day Netherlands. The Netherlands became an independent country after
                            the Treaty of Münster in 1648 and was renamed the Republic of the Seven United Provinces.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While Spanish Jews settled in the Netherlands in the 16th century, they and others,
                            most likely Crypto-Jews, also settled in Antwerp and Bruges.
                            At the beginning of the 16th century, the Crypto-Jews living in Antwerp played an
                            important role in the economic and financial affairs of the town. Because of Spanish
                            pressure, most of them left Antwerp around 1540–1550, ending the second Jewish
                            immigration in the region.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although some Crypto-Jews returned to Antwerp during the 17th century, they could no
                            longer enjoy the same economic and financial status they had a century earlier.
                            A secret synagogue existed in Antwerp from 1650 to 1694, and some Crypto-Jewish poets
                            also lived in Brussels during that time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After Antwerp came under Austrian rule in 1713, Jews were able to practice their religion
                            more openly. They gained even greater freedom following the promulgation of the
                            “Edict of Tolerance” by Habsburg Emperor Joseph II in 1781.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the 18th century, Jewish presence in the Southern provinces, under Austrian
                            rule, remained low; about 100 Jews – householders – lived in Brussels in 1756.

                            In 1808, under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, around 800 Jews were integrated into two
                            Belgian consistories established as part of the Napoleonic system for organizing recognized
                            religions.

                        <p>
                            In 1816, an official Jewish community of approximately 150 individuals was established in
                            Antwerp, known as the <em>Communauté Israélite</em>. The first communal Jewish prayers were
                            held in the home of Moise Kreyn, with the approval of the city authorities. In 1828, the
                            Jewish community of Antwerp acquired its own cemetery. By 1829, the Jewish population of
                            Antwerp numbered 151.

                            Following the Belgian Revolution of 1830, Belgium gained independence and became the Kingdom
                            of Belgium. The Belgian Constitution proclaimed the separation of church and state and
                            guaranteed freedom of religion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1831, one year after independence, Judaism was officially recognized as a religion, with
                            the <em>Consistoire Central Israélite de Belgique</em> designated as its official
                            representative body. Jewish religious practice was guaranteed, and Jewish education was
                            legally organized by national authorities, notably under the supervision of the Ministry of
                            Justice.

                            Today, the Jewish Central Consistory of Belgium is responsible for managing practical

                            cantors, beadles, ritual slaughterers, and religious teachers, as well as the official
                            recognition of synagogues.

                            During the 19th century, the Jewish population of Belgium increased gradually through the
                            arrival of Jews from Alsace and Lorraine in southern Belgium, German Jews in Brussels, and
                            Dutch Jews in Antwerp, who later established the <a
                                href="hollandse-synagoge.html"><em>Hollandse Synagoge</em></a>. The
                            consistories instituted under Napoleon continued to serve as a model for the organization of
                            Jewish religious life in Belgium.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By 1880, the Jewish population of Belgium was estimated at approximately 4,300 individuals.
                            Following the assassination of the Russian Tsar in 1881, a new wave of mass emigration from
                            Eastern Europe occurred as a result of pogroms. For many of these refugees,
                            Belgium—particularly Antwerp—served as a transit point on the way to the United States.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In addition, Sephardic Jews migrated to Belgium from the Ottoman Empire during the

                            By the mid-19th century, the port of Antwerp had become one of the largest in Europe.
                            Regular transatlantic sea connections were established, notably through the <a
                                href="#"><em>Red
                                    Star Line</em></a>, which transported millions of emigrants to the United States.
                            While many
                            Jewish refugees initially intended to emigrate onward, some chose to settle permanently in
                            Antwerp, Arlon, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Liège, and Ostend. By 1914, the Jewish
                            population of Belgium was estimated to have reached approximately 40,000 individuals.

                        <h2>Pre-War Period (1918–1939)</h2>
                        <p>
                            After the First World War, Antwerp emerged as the principal center of Jewish life in
                            Belgium. Although the war caused disruption and displacement, the interwar years saw renewed
                            growth of the Jewish population, particularly in Antwerp, which attracted Jews from Eastern
                            Europe as well as refugees fleeing political instability, economic hardship, and rising
                            antisemitism elsewhere in Europe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the 1920s and 1930s, Antwerp’s Jewish population grew rapidly and became one of the
                            largest in Western Europe. By the late 1930s, estimates suggest that between 35,000 and
                            50,000 Jews were living in Antwerp alone, representing the majority of Belgium’s Jewish
                            population. The community was highly diverse, consisting of Eastern European Ashkenazi Jews,
                            long-established Dutch and German Jewish families, and smaller Sephardic groups.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Economically, Jews played a central role in Antwerp’s diamond industry, which became one of
                            the city’s defining economic sectors. Jewish diamantaires, traders, and workers were active
                            at all levels of the trade, and the industry attracted additional Jewish migration. Beyond
                            diamonds, Jews were also involved in commerce, small manufacturing, tailoring, and
                            maritime-related professions.

                        <p>
                            Religious and communal life flourished during the interwar period. Numerous synagogues,
                            prayer houses, and study circles operated throughout the city, reflecting a wide range of
                            religious observance from Orthodox to more liberal traditions. Major synagogues such as the
                            Hollands Synagoge and the Romi Goldmuntz Synagogue became central institutions of Jewish
                            life. Jewish schools provided both religious and general education, <a href="#"><em>Jesode
                                    Hatorah</em></a> (founded 1895), and <a href="#"><em>Tachkemoni</em></a> (founded
                            1920), and the yeshiva
                            founded in Heide in 1929—the first Talmudic high school
                            in Belgium. Charitable organizations, cultural associations, and political
                            movements—including Zionist, socialist, and religious groups—were active and well organized.

                        <p>
                            During the same period, a significant Jewish community also developed in the nearby district
                            of Heide (part of Kalmthout). Starting in the 1920s, Jews from Antwerp were drawn to Heide
                            both as holiday visitors and as permanent residents, contributing to the rapid growth and
                            prosperity of the area. Between 1930 and 1942, there were at least 700 registered Jewish
                            residents in Heide, and many more visited during weekends and summer months. The community
                            established the only synagogue in Belgium outside a major city, constructed in 1927–28, and
                            in 1929 founded the yeshiva. Hotels and boarding houses in Heide catered specifically to
                            Jewish tourists and residents. This vibrant Jewish presence reflected broader patterns of
                            mobility within the Antwerp region during the interwar years.

                            Despite this vibrant communal life, the 1930s also brought growing insecurity. The rise of
                            fascism and Nazism in neighboring countries, combined with the arrival of Jewish refugees
                            from Germany and Austria after 1933, increased tensions within Belgian society. Antisemitic
                            movements and rhetoric became more visible in Antwerp, particularly in the late 1930s,
                            foreshadowing the dangers that would soon confront the Jewish population with the outbreak
                            of the Second World War.
